# Maximum number of articles to learn from PER FEED
# For each feed, learn up to this many read articles (not total)
# Example: 50 articles per feed × 100 feeds = 5000 total learned articles

# Similarity threshold for duplicate detection (0-100)
# Articles with similarity >= this value are marked as duplicates

# Options: "token_sort", "token_set", "jaccard", or "combined"
# "combined" uses all methods and takes the highest score

# Sleep time between checks (in seconds)

# Feed IDs to not star (comma-separated)
# Articles from these feeds will only be marked read, not starred

# Feed IDs that should only compare against articles from the same feed
# Use this for feeds that have similar content but shouldn't be deduped cross-feed
# Example: internal_only = [123, 456]

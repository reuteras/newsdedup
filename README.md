# newsdedup
A project to deduplicate my news feed.

For a long time I've added a lot of RSS feeds and now I've ended up with a lot
of duplicate entries for big stories. With this project I aim to move duplicates
to starred and mark them as read. This might change in the future if I find a
better way to do it.

To run the code as a daemon under systemd you can do the following steps:

    mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
    cp newsdedup.service.default ~/.config/systemd/user/newsdedup.service
    systemctl --user enable newsdedup.service
    systemctl --user start newsdedup.service

To watch the logs you can run:

    journalctl -f --user-unit newsdedup

Unmark stared articles from the command line with:

    ./unstar.py

This branch is for Python 2.
